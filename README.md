# Envelope Follower VST Audio Plugin
A JUCE project, written in C++, that exports as a user-selected format of audio plugin (typically .VST) for use in a digital audio workstation (DAW). The plugin was created specifically for a head of the University of Oregon Music Technology department, and is used as a tool in the related Data Sonification class. The plugin reads amplitude values of a user-selected audio channel, normalizes the data on the standard 0-127 value scale, and outputs it as data that can be used to automate any parameter within the DAW. Developed in a team of six people.
